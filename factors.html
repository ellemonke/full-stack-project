                <p>Each circle represents the correlation between two factors on the grid. The higher the coefficient, the more
                    correlated the two factors are, 1.0 being perfectly correlated. If the coefficient is less than 0.05 and greater
                    than -0.05, the two factors are not likely correlated. Less than -0.05 indicates a negative correlation.</p>

                        <li><strong>Happiness (Score)</strong> is based on the Gallup World Poll question to rate one's own overall happiness on a scale from 1 to 10.</li>
                        <li><strong>Economy</strong> is based on adjusted GDP per capita in terms of PPP (Purchasing Power Parity).</li>
                        <li><strong>Family/Social Support</strong> is based on the average binary of the poll question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them?”</li>
                        <li><strong>Health</strong> is based on real data of life expectancy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Freedom</strong> is based on the average binary of the poll question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”</li>
                        <li><strong>Trust</strong> is based on the average binary of the poll question “Is corruption widespread throughout the government (or businesses)?”</li>
                        <li><strong>Generosity</strong> is based on regressing the average of answers to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” against national GDP per capita.</li>
                        <li><strong>Residual</strong> is the residual of other factors of happiness not already listed above (2015-2017).</li>

            <p>Of all the factors - Economy, Family, and Health seem to correlate the most with overall
                happiness. Over the years, these factors have become even a more correlated with overall happiness. Prior to 2018, 
                Trust (in the government) and Generosity were significantly correlated with happiness along with most of the other factors. 
                However between 2017 and 2018, trust in the government became less correlated with happiness. Between 2016 and 2018, generosity
                became increasingly correlated with happiness, but then suddenly in 2019 it became less correlated to all factors and 
                negatively correlated to the economy.
