                <p>Each circle represents the correlation between two factors on the grid. The higher the coefficient, the more

                <ol id="factors">
                    <li><strong>Happiness (Score)</strong> is based on the Gallup World Poll question rating one's own overall happiness on a scale from 1 to 10.</li>
                    <li><strong>Economy</strong> is based on adjusted GDP per capita in terms of PPP (Purchasing Power Parity).</li>
                    <li><strong>Family/Social Support</strong> is based on the average binary of the poll question “If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them?”</li>
                    <li><strong>Health</strong> is based on real data of life expectancy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Freedom</strong> is based on the average binary of the poll question “Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?”</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust</strong> is based on the average binary of the poll question “Is corruption widespread throughout the government (or businesses)?”</li>
                    <li><strong>Generosity</strong> is based on regressing the average of answers to the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” against national GDP per capita.</li>
                    <li><strong>Residual</strong> is the combination of other factors not already listed above that contribute to happiness.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Of all the factors - Economy, Family, and Health have the strongest correlations to overall happiness. Freedom and
                Trust have moderate correlations with happiness. Generosity appears to be uncorrelated with happiness. Freedom, 
                Trust and Generosity have low to moderate correlations with one another. Residual factors of happiness are 
                uncorrelated with the other factors but still strongly correlate with overall happiness. These relationships vary 
                only slightly from year to year.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>Of all the factors - Economy, Family, and Health have the strongest correlations to overall happiness. Prior to 2017,
                Trust (in the government) was moderately correlated with overall happiness. In 2017 and after, Trust (in the government)
                became less correlated with happiness. Conversely, Generosity became increasingly correlated with overall happiness
                after 2017. In 2019, when Economy became more correlated to happiness, Generosity dropped in correlation to most factors 
                but still contributed to overall happiness.
