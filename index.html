                        Happiness Report</a>
                    reported by the U.N. is a survey of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their
                    citizens perceive
                    themselves to be. The ranks and scores use data from the 2015-2019 Gallup World Polls. The scores
                    are based on the
                    extent to which six main factors – Economy (GDP), Family (Social Support), Health (Life Expectancy),
                    Freedom, Trust
                    (Government Corruption), Generosity, plus residual factors – contribute to overall happiness. This
                    overview of the
                    report analyzes each factor and provides an interactive world map to view how the people of each
                    country perceive their
                    own happiness.

                    <h5> Hover over a region in the legend to see its position on the chart. Bubble size corresponds to
                        the
                        country's overall happiness score. </h5>
                </center>

                <h3>Economy</h3>
                <p>
                    Across all years in the data set, Economy, as measured by GDP per capita, correlates most highly
                    with
                    a country's overall happiness score. Countries with greater GDPs thus demonstrate higher Overall
                    Happiness Scores.

                </p>

                <h3>Family</h3>
                <p>
                    Family measures the average of responses to the yes/no question "If you were in trouble, do you have
                    relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them?" There is less variance
                    here among countries, with the noticeable exception of certain countries that have recently
                    experienced civil war, extreme political unrest, and/or fallout from a natural disaster. The most
                    variance among Norther America, Latina America & the Caribbean, and Western Europe appears in 2016.

                </p>

                <h3>Health</h3>
                <p>
                    Health, as measured by life expectency, is highly correlated to overall happiness. As with Economy,
                    Australia and New Zealand, North America, Western Europe, and parts of Central and Eastern Europe,
                    the Middle East, and Latin America do well here. Countries in Eastern Asia (Hong Kong, South Korea,
                    and Japan)
                    also stand out. As of 2019, there is a slight increase in life expectency for countries in
                    Sub-Saharan Africa.
                </p>

                <h3>Freedom</h3>
                <p>
                    Freedom, like Health, measures the average response to the yes/no question "Are you satisfied or
                    dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?", and does not correlate as
                    strongly to Overall Happiness as some of the other factors examined. Many countries in
                    Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeastern Asia, which otherwise have much lower overall happiness scores,
                    demonstrate freedom scores on par with North America and Western Europe. On the other hand, many
                    countries in Central and Eastern Europe have much lower Freedom scores relative to their Health or
                    Economy Scores.

                </p>

                <h3>Trust</h3>
                <p>
                    Trust measures answers to the yes/no question "Is corruption widespread throughout the government
                    (or businesses)?". The data shows a very weak correlation between Trust and Overall Happiness. The
                    Scandinavian countries of Western Europe and New Zealand show a high level of trust, along with
                    Singapore, Rwanda, and Qatar. Many countries do not score highly in this category.

                </p>

                <h3>Generosity</h3>

                <p>
                    Generosity scores are calculated through a regression analysis of the average of yes/no answers to
                    the question “Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?” and national GDP per capita.
                    There is a weak correlation between Generosity and Overall Happiness. Myanmar, Indonesia, and
                    Thailand demonstrate the highest Generosity scores relative to Overall Happiness.

                </p>

                <h3>Dystopia Residual</h3>
                <p>
                    A country's Dystopia Residual accounts for those factors which contribute to Overall Happiness but
                    are not captured in any of the above categories. It is calculated by substracting each score in the
                    above categories from the Overall Happiness Score. Many countries in Latin America and the
                    Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeastern Asia have some of the highest Residual scores
                    relative to their Overall Happiness scores.
