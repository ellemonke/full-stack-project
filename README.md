# World Happiness
by Bryan Domogalla, Ellen Hsu, Rachel Hunter

## Project Summary
The World Happiness Report is a survey of global happiness reported by the United Nations. The overall Happiness Score includes measures of: Family, Health (Life Expectancy), Freedom, Trust (Government Corruption), Generosity, and Dystopia Residual - which are other contributors to happiness not among those already listed. 

We would possibly like to explore how these happiness factors compare in different regions/countries; any significant changes in individual factors; and/or correlations between two or more happiness factors.
